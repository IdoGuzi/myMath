*The first readme file of MATLA 0 also attached and the name is 'readMe.docx' in this folder.

In our implementation we treated all kind of cases according to the orders.
Its mean exceptions, notes and documentations, private function when needed and sub-functions, and good math that closet to the theorem. Please read the javaDoc or the function note, we explained our code there, also WIKI file.
